"is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including"
" the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a"
" variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to"
" run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights"
" from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and"
" providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics."
